# ExpertEvents

## Summary

Are you a student struggling to attract attendees for your organization's events through posters and Instagram posts? Alternatively, do you often miss out on exciting campus events because you only learn about them after they've concluded? ExpertEvents is the solution. With a user-friendly interface, event recommendations, and seamless integration with your calendar app, ExpertEvents keeps you in the loop with real-time notifications. This app enables organizers to promote events to the entire student population and allows students to stay informed about campus happenings, effortlessly notifying and inviting friends and engaging in discussions through our in-app community space. ExpertEvents is where events come to life, and the campus community thrives.

# Tech Stack

## Front-End: [Flutter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8saLa5fh0ZI)

### Flutter Installation
Easy to learn, works on both macs and windows, good for mobile applications, contains helpful libraries as well

- [Flutter Docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/)
- [Implement OCR with Firebase Cloud Functions and Google Cloud Vision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTEU10c3gds)

## Back-End: Firebase
Easily compatible with Flutter, works well with Google Cloud OCR

### Resources:

- [Creating events in Google Calendar (100 Days of Google Dev)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNo9IoZMelI&t=353s)

### APIs
- [Google Calendar](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/guides/overview)
- [Google cloud OCR](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/ocr)

## Software to Install

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (version control)
- [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/editor) 
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) 

## Roadblocks and Possible Solutions

- Difficult to implement the Google Cloud image OCR in the backend (Firebase)
  - There is a way to implement directly in Flutter
  - [Flutter Plugin to use Google Vision API](https://pub.dev/packages/google_ml_vision)
  - However, using the Google Cloud OCR in the backend is more accurate
  - [Read this article for more info](https://medium.com/dreamwod-tech/cloud-vision-vs-flutter-mlkit-for-ocr-detection-of-concept2-machine-514098f894af)

- Implementing accurate information into Google Calendar
- Handling multiple user types and corresponding user views: Organizations, Students, Friends

## Competition

- Posting event poster/updates on Instagram stories/posts to update followers (not as efficient since people may follow multiple accounts and that post may get lost/ having to check stories to see any updates)
- Hanging posters around campus(old school way)
- UTD app has events tab (only includes university hosted events)
